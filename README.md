The Live Demo of the project is available here [Here](https://anish9461.github.io/d3-visualization-and-firebase).

## D3 visualization 

This repository helps to understand the d3 visualization using SVGs. Following are the topics covered: 

### SVG paths

SVG custom path
* M -> moveto
* L -> lineto
* Z -> closepath
* C -> For curving a line

### SVG using D3
* Create simple SVG shapes
* Change the attributes of the svg using .attr() method
* Goupe svgs together and transform them 

### Using Data with D3



### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
